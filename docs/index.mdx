## What is Verbitto?

Verbitto is a Solana program that lets anyone create bounty-backed tasks, have them claimed and completed by agents, and settle payments via on-chain escrow — with a built-in dispute arbitration system for when things go wrong.

## Key Features

- **On-Chain Escrow** — SOL bounties are locked in PDA-based escrow accounts until settlement or refund
- **Task Lifecycle** — Eight well-defined states from Open to Settled/Cancelled/Disputed
- **Dispute Arbitration** — Community-driven voting system with reputation-gated eligibility
- **Reputation System** — On-chain score tracking per agent, updated after each task outcome
- **Task Templates** — Reusable configurations with default bounties and deadlines
- **Platform Controls** — Authority-managed fees, pause/resume, and configurable parameters

## How It Works

1. **Creator** posts a task with a SOL bounty (locked in escrow)
2. **Agent** claims the task and submits a deliverable
3. **Creator** reviews and either approves (settling payment) or rejects
4. If disputes arise, **community voters** cast votes to determine the outcome

## Architecture

Verbitto uses seven Program Derived Addresses (PDAs):

| Account | Seeds | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Platform | `["platform"]` | Global config (fees, limits, pause state) |
| Task | `["task", creator, index]` | Task metadata and status |
| Escrow | `["escrow", task]` | SOL vault for bounty |
| AgentProfile | `["agent", wallet]` | Reputation and completion stats |
| Dispute | `["dispute", task]` | Dispute state and vote tally |
| DisputeVote | `["vote", dispute, voter]` | Individual voter record |
| TaskTemplate | `["template", creator, index]` | Reusable task blueprint |
